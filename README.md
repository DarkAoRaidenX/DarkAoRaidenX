### Yo, there ðŸ‘‹



###âš¡About Meâš¡
I struggle everyday with various mental and physical impairments that leave me super drained, tired, and the will to do nothing. Because of those struggles, I missed out on a lot of stuff growing up and even now like games and socialness.

I try to stream on Twitch(Whenever Me or My Internet feels like it)
