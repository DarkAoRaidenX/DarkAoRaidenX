### About Me
âš¡I struggle everyday with various mental and physical impairments that leave me super drained, tired, and the will to do nothing. Because of those struggles, I missed out on a lot of stuff growing up and even now like games and socialness.âš¡

I try to stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/darkaoraidenx)(Whenever Me or My Internet feels like it). Main games I would like to play is Co-op games. Don't care for competive/pvp type games.
